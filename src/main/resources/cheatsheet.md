# Disclaimer
While there is a fairly clear line of progression, some items have multiple means of obtaining them, allowing for more player choice. Some things may be subject to change.

# Dread Tier
These items can be acquired from the Dread Moon, meaning the only barrier to entry is the player's preparedness and the world's timing.

## Dreadful Wisps
This material drops from all mobs of the Dread Moon. They are also found in ancient city loot.

# Amethyst Tier
These items can be acquired after finding an amethyst geode or finding amethyst through other means.

## Amethyst Shards; Attuned Amethyst
Amethyst shards are found in geodes and ancient city loot. Charging amethyst shards with energy is also available and necessary to use some of the crafting stations, primarily the refinery.

## Refined Cauldron [Crafting Station]
The refined cauldron is unlocked, though its apothecary recipes are locked behind the Nether.

## Refinery [Crafting Station]
The refinery takes power from attuned amethysts to combine materials into new processed materials.

# Memory Tier
These items can be acquired before reaching the Nether by visiting the Deep Dark or an Ancient City.

## Memory Dust; Managold

# Insanity Tier
These items can be acquired from becoming insane and fighting insanity mobs.

## Nightmare Fuel
This drops from hostile insanity mobs.

## Subdued Madness; Nightmarrow
Subdued madness drops from the Acharos. While it can be acquired at any time, the Acharos is a tough opponent. Nightmarrow is created in a refinery from subdued madness and a bone.

# Nether Tier
These items can be acquired from the Nether after beating the Lord's Phantasm.

## Nether Wart
Locked behind nether wart is the entire apothecary system. It can be found in nether fortresses.

## Tormite Ingots; Threads of Sanity
