# The Elements

## Reality
The power of groundedness, embodied by the Overworld and Nether.

## Imagination
The power of mind and soul, embodied by the Spirit World.

## Cosmos
The power of balance and equilibrium, embodied by the End.

# The Affliction
The affliction is the root of undeath, the source of madness and consumption, and the cause of the fall of Koinans. It manifests itself in several forms based on the various aspects of mind and soul.

At its heart, the affliction is a plague born of necromantic origin, created by those who wished to utilize the power of mind and soul to open a gate to the Haven and live eternally.

## Zombification
The affliction turned the souls of the Koinans rancid and consumed them until all that was left were zombified husks. Much of intelligent life has been zombified. Some of those that are not are still susceptible, but the airborne affliction is not enough to affect them.

## Wither
Withering is a horrid rot of the flesh that is responsible for the skeleton varieties and the soul aggregates of the Nether.

## Sculk
The first form of the affliction, sculk is soul twisted into a cancer that taints the world. Enough soul has been concentrated in the depths of the mountains to create Wardens, titans containing a nearly limitless supply of raw, concentrated soul, always hungering for more.

## Crimson
Crimson is a stain wrought from afflicting the haven. Its influence waxes and wanes, turning the moon red with blood at its peaks. It strengthens the undead taken by the affliction and increases their ability to spread the blight.

## Madness
The same force that twisted soul to sculk twisted dream to madness. The shadows have congealed into terrible monsters that haunt the world, looking for those whose minds have been bent toward imagination enough to interact with them.


# Spirit World
The Spirit World is the holy land. It is made up of 2 layers: the Dream World and the Haven.

## Dream World
The Dream World is the land the mind taps when asleep, scratching the surface and experiencing within it nonsense. Methods exist to enter the Dream World while still lucid. The Dream World is the lower layer of the Dream World.

## The (Forsaken) Haven
The Haven is the upper layer of the Spirit World. It was once the land of the dead, at least those benevolent, and it was thought that the secrets to immortality can be found there. It was also home to angels.

When the affliction began to taint the Overworld, it escaped into the Haven where it took the denizens like a plague. The dead were twisted into the Enkatal, and the angels fell, becoming the Talei.

During the Age of the Illagers, Elrunez the Archmage opened the long-sealed portal to the Haven and took control of it. Elrunez named himself the Nightmare Lord and takes up residence in the Soul Spire.


# The Affliction's Onset
The Koinans were a race of humanoids adept in construction of tools and structures. They lasted about 10,000 years before falling to their own creation.

## The Spark
The first sources of magic to be discovered were amethyst and silver. They were used to tap into the energies of the mind and soul. It started small with simply turning memories to dust, but soon they began liquifying souls.

Using these resources and others available, the Koinans were able to construct portals to the End. Using cosmic fluid and silver, they were able to turn dreams to powder and enter the Dream World.

## The Blight
Direct attempts to extend the Koinans' lives exploded into sculk. Next, they attempted to create new life instead, and they succeeded in creating the creepers: living demolition instruments. However, the creepers lacked an intelligence, and the attempts to give them one instead created the Madness, a force that threatened those distanced too far from reality with Tormentors.

Over time, the sculk amassed enough energy to form the wardens. As immense power sources, the Koinans realized they may contain the energy to open a gate to a realm even higher than that of the Dream. They designed a gate that would absorb all the power from a warden to open a portal that would lead to the Haven.

When the Koinans attempted the process of powering the portal with a warden, the portal absorbed too much energy from the Warden and became overloaded, unequipped with the ability to contain it all. The portal convulsed and ruptured, scattering a terrible malady - the Affliction - all across both the Overworld and the Haven.

All the Koinans within a mile were turned to zombies who continued to spread the blight. The souls of the dead in the Haven turned into the Enkatal, and the angels were corrupted to the Talei. Many of those whom survived fled to the Nether. In an act of desperation, they tried to construct simulacrums which could house their souls. These too failed, creating withering. The simulacrums turned to wither skeletons, while the Koinans turned to skeletons under the withering decay.

## The Aftermath
All the structures of the Koinans were left for abandoned or house undead. The sculk was allowed to spread far through the caves in which they were produced. The moon, being a reflection of the Haven, was cursed with crimson. Silver, being the metal of the Haven, was nearly petrified, turning to rose quartz.

The illager race evolved long after the fall of the Koinans. The zombies could sense their intelligence and attempted to convert them, but they were more resistant to the affliction than the Koinans.




# Miscellanious Entities
Many beings inhabit the world or have inhabited the world. These are the ones not explained elsewhere.

## Spiders
Their origins are unknown. They were here long before the Koinans, and they seem to know well enough to avoid attacking the other monsters.
