# The Elements

## Reality
The power of solidity and order, embodied by the End, the Sun, and ice.

## Imagination
The power of mind and soul, embodied by the Spirit World, the Moon, and the affliction.

## Wrath
The power of hatred and retribution, embodied by the Nether, fire, and electricity.

# The Materials
The many materials of the world reflect different elements and their nuances.

## Mind Powders
Memory dust is a mass of memory and soul, now uncomprehendible but full of power. Dream powder is instead a mass of dreams. The two are so interconnected that they can flow between each other with the aid of flowing spirit.

# The Affliction
The affliction is the root of undeath, the source of madness and consumption, and the cause of the fall of Koinans. It manifests itself in several forms based on the various aspects of mind and soul.

At its heart, the affliction is a plague born of necromantic origin, created by those who wished to utilize the power of mind and soul to live eternally and reach the Haven illegitimately.

## Zombification
The affliction turned the souls of the Koinans rancid and consumed them until all that was left were zombified husks. Much of intelligent life has been zombified. Some of those that are not are still susceptible, but the airborne affliction is not enough to affect them.

## Wither
Withering is a horrid rot of the flesh that is responsible for the skeleton varieties and the soul aggregates of the Nether.

## Sculk
The first form of the affliction, sculk is soul twisted into a cancer that taints the world. Enough soul has been concentrated in the depths of the mountains to create Wardens, titans containing a nearly limitless supply of raw, concentrated soul, always hungering for more.

## Madness
The same force that twisted soul to sculk twisted dream to madness. The shadows have congealed into terrible monsters that haunt the world, looking for those whose minds have been bent toward imagination enough to interact with them.


# Spirit World
The Spirit World is the holy land. It is made up of 2 layers: the Dream World and the Haven.

## Dream World
The Dream World is the land the mind taps when asleep, scratching the surface and experiencing within it nonsense. Methods exist to enter the Dream World while still lucid. The Dream World is the lower layer of the Dream World.

## The (Forsaken) Haven
The Haven is the upper layer of the Spirit World. It was once the land of the dead, at least those benevolent, and it was thought that the secrets to immortality can be found there. It was also home to angels.

When the affliction began to taint the Overworld, it escaped into the Haven where it took the denizens like a plague. The dead were twisted into the Enkatal, and the angels fell, becoming the Talei.

During the Age of the Illagers, Elrunez the Archmage opened the long-sealed portal to the Haven and took control of it. Elrunez named himself the Nightmare Lord and takes up residence in the Soul Spire.


# The Affliction's Onset
The Koinans were a race of humanoids adept in construction of tools and structures. They lasted about 10,000 years before falling to their own creation.

## The Spark
The first sources of magic to be discovered were amethyst and opal. They were used to tap into the energies of the mind and soul. It started small with simply turning memories to dust, but soon they began liquifying souls.

Using these resources and others available, the Koinans were able to construct portals to the End. Using cosmic fluid and opal, they were able to turn dreams to powder and enter the Dream World.

## The Blight
Direct attempts to extend the Koinans' lives exploded into sculk. Next, they attempted to create new life instead, and they succeeded in creating the creepers: living demolition instruments. However, the creepers lacked an intelligence, and the attempts to give them one instead created the Madness, a force that threatened those distanced too far from reality with Tormentors.

Over time, the sculk amassed enough energy to form the wardens. As immense power sources, the Koinans realized they may contain the energy to open a gate to a realm even higher than that of the Dream. They designed a gate that would absorb all the power from a warden to open a portal that would lead to the Haven.

When the Koinans attempted the process of powering the portal with a warden, the portal absorbed too much energy from the Warden and became overloaded, unequipped with the ability to contain it all. The portal convulsed and ruptured, scattering a terrible malady - the Affliction - all across both the Overworld and the Haven.

All the Koinans within a mile were turned to zombies who continued to spread the blight. The souls of the dead in the Haven turned into the Enkatal, and the angels were corrupted to the Talei. Many of those whom survived fled to the Nether. In an act of desperation, they tried to construct simulacrums which could house their souls. These too failed, creating withering. The simulacrums turned to wither skeletons, while the Koinans turned to skeletons under the withering decay.

## The Aftermath of the Koinans
All the structures of the Koinans were left for abandoned or house undead. The sculk was allowed to spread far through the caves in which they were produced. Opal, being the gemstone of the Haven, lost much of its holy energy and turned to rose quartz. Meanwhile, the divine metal of silver seemed to vanish from all record with the fall of angels.

The illager race evolved long after the fall of the Koinans. The zombies could sense their intelligence and attempted to convert them, but they were more resistant to the affliction than the Koinans. They discovered some of the remains of the Koinans, including the ancient cities, but they were mostly unsuccessful with rebuilding them.

## The Nightmare Lord
Elrunez was a powerful illager archmage. The details of his rise to power among illagers remain a mystery, but his insights into new forms of magic are not. He developed a way to unravel his own sanity and inflict upon himself a madness that let him see the congealing shadows.

Using the threads of his own sanity, Elrunez was able to reinforce the ancient portal frame against overloading. After properly tuning the portal frame, he used a warden to fuel the portal, which managed to remain stable after overloading. However, the portal remained overconcentrated and, rather than leading to the Haven, the portal let out the spirits of those taken by sculk. This lasted until the portal's energy reached stable levels, at which point Elrunez entered.

Once inside, Elrunez was able to fully embrace the madness of unreality and be taken by torment, crowning himself the Nightmare Lord. He then sealed the ancient portal and began locking it with the essence of 4 powerful Keepers, ensuring himself the last of all lords.


# Bosses
## Pnevma, Ender Dragon
The Ender Dragon was constructed by Elrunez to drown out the force of reality. Made of nightmares and madness, Pnevma plagues the End and suppresses the World Fountain by sponging up its energy. The dragon thusly can withstand the force of reality and even wield it despite being an entity of insanity. This has dried up the minds of the endermen living in the End, stealing their wits and binding them to the will of Pnevma.

This task has been taxing to the element of imagination and has neutralized it somewhat. This has prevented the creation of dream powder.

## The Wither, Hand of the Plague
An amalgamation of failed simulacrums, the Wither is the embodiment of the decaying force of the affliction that created the skeletons. It cares only to infect intelligent life and was the main spreader of the decay. Once its corrupted purpose was served, it collapsed into a heap of bones and skulls.

Reawakened by the player, the Wither's new purpose is to kill them and any other sapient beings nearby. When slain, it will drop its nether star: a crystalized power source formed from electrified souls.

## Architects' Siege & The Wraith King
The siege is begun by an influx of power in the ancient portal, twisted by madness to allow the spirits of the dead to come forth, twisted by sculk and madness. The portal, while stabilized by Elrunez, is tainted by insanity and will not become usable until the madness settles.

The energy stolen from the warden by the ancient portal eventually retakes the shape of the warden, now an entity only of mind, soul, and madness. Destroying this entity will stabilize the portal.


# Miscellanious Entities
Many beings inhabit the world or have inhabited the world. These are the ones not explained elsewhere.

## Spiders
Their origins are unknown. They were here long before the Koinans, and they seem to know well enough to avoid attacking the other monsters.
