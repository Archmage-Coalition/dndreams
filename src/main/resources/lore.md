# The Affliction
The affliction is the root of undeath, the source of madness and corruption, and the undoing of the ancient Vesican empire. It manifests itself in several forms based on the various aspects of mind and soul.

The heart of the affliction is known as the Formless Flame. It is a primordial, demonic energy that attempts to burn down the natural order, and the mind and soul with it.

## Sculk
The first form of the affliction, sculk is a soul-eating cancer that taints the world. Enough soul has been concentrated in the depths of the mountains to create Wardens, titans containing a nearly limitless supply of raw, concentrated soul, always hungering for more. Nothing distinct remains within the sculk, having reduced the souls consumed into a mixture of pointless memories.

## Madness
The affliction haunts the world, weighing down on the few souls that remain. It can be resisted to some degree, but once it is let in, it can be very difficult to shut out again. The affliction is a madness that tugs on and rots the soul until it is unrecognizable.

## Wither
Withering is the outward rotting of the flesh that follows the rotting of the soul.

## Undead
All who have lost the battle against madness have their souls consumed by the affliction, becoming undead slaves to the affliction's will. Some completely lose their minds while others completely lose their flesh, but in both cases, only the semblance of life remains. For most, it is incurable.


# The Other Realms
The many realms of the world are split into 2 categories: the Physical Realms and the Spirit World.

## The Overworld
The Overworld is the primary realm of the world. It is where the Vesicans originated and fell, and it was hurt the worst by the onset of the affliction.

## The Nether
The Nether is the demonic home world and a hellish reflection of the Overworld.

## The End
The End was once home to dragons, but they have long since perished (it is unknown why). Now, the only dragon to remain is Pnevma, the Ender Dragon, and even she was synthetically created. The End is, as a result, now barren, except for the gardens of marble populated by the angels that Elrunez banished there. It contains the World Fountain, from which fate and change flows.

## Dream World
The Dream World is the land the mind taps when asleep, scratching the surface and experiencing within it nonsense. Methods exist to enter the Dream World while still lucid. The Dream World is the lower layer of the Spirit World.

## The (Forsaken) Haven
The Haven is the upper layer of the Spirit World. It was once the land of the dead, at least those benevolent, and it was thought that the secrets to immortality can be found there. It was also home to angels.

When the affliction began to taint the Overworld, it escaped into the Haven where it took the denizens like a plague. The dead were twisted into the Enkantal, beginning a ceaseless battle against the angels of the realm.

During the Age of the Illagers, Elrunez the Archmage opened the long-sealed portal to the Haven and took control of it. In a complicated coup, Elrunez banished the angels who stood against him and crowned himself Lord of the Spirit World. The angels he banished alongside Aktina, the former ruler of the Spirit World, were known as the Katharei, and those loyal to Elrunez became the Talei.


# The Fall of the Vesicans [Deprecated]
The Vesicans were a race of humanoids adept in construction of tools and structures. They lasted an arbitrary amount of time, and their fall was caused by their arrogance.

## The War on Demons
In a war that far predates the cataclysm that would befall the Vesicans, the demons of the Nether fought mankind and ultimately lost due to the blessing of Aktina. Most demons were destroyed, but the Great Demon of Torment would not die so easily. Rather than let himself get killed, he dragged both his own soul and the souls of a great army of men deep underground where he burned them and himself, transforming into the Formless Flame.

## The Flame's Discovery & Influence
Long after the War on Demons, of which most details had been forgotten, the Formless Flame and the sculk that surrounded it was found by the Vesicans. It offered them new abilities that they could use to solve their problems, possibly even to live forever. However, as the Vesicans used the powers provided by the Formless Flame, it began to influence them and control them. The Formless Flame convinced the Vesicans to feed their enemies and criminals to it, crumbling them into miserable heaps of amalgamated memories.

## The Outbreak
The Vesicans wished to bring back the dead from the afterlife, and they built a portal to the Haven that would be fueled by soul power. However, a seal placed between the Haven and the physical realms by the dragons prevented them from using their portal. Yet the seal was maintained by the World Fountain, and it provided a link for the Formless Flame to weave itself into the Fountain's streams, scattering madness and rot through the fate of the world. The Vesicans, unprepared, almost all got consumed by the madness, becoming undead. Only a few survived, and even they were fighting against the encroaching darkness.

## The Aftermath of the Vesicans
All the structures of the Vesicans were left for abandoned or house undead. The sculk was allowed to spread far through the caves in which they were produced. Opal, being the gemstone of the Haven, lost much of its holy energy and turned to rose quartz. Meanwhile, the divine metal of silver seemed to vanish from all record with the fall of angels.

Over time, the descendants of the survivors evolved into the illagers, who had a heightened resistance to the affliction. They eventually rediscovered some of the remains of the Vesicans, including the ancient cities, but they were mostly unsuccessful with rebuilding them.

## The Lord of Torment
Elrunez was a powerful mage among the illagers. When he found the Formless Flame, he used its power to rise to the top. Unlike his ancestors, he was more resistant to the manipulative powers of the Formless Flame, but he was not and is not immune. In the search of knowledge and power, Elrunez found and opened the portal to the Haven that had once been the undoing of the Vesicans.

Once inside, Elrunez staged a coup on the angelic throne, managing to overthrow Aktina. Elrunez then banished the angels not loyal to him to the End. Aktina herself was locked within a cage of shadow, and she did the only thing she could: maintain a seal between the Haven and the other realms so that no-one worse could enter and take the Formless Flame.


# Artifacts
## The Crowned Edge
This magical blade was forged by Elrunez himself from the flow of the World Fountain. Contained within is an ancient draconic marrow, which infuses the weapon with the death magic that defeated the angels.

## The Atlas of Frosyni
???


# Bosses
## Pnevma, the Ender Dragon
The Ender Dragon was constructed by Elrunez to control the World Fountain. By stopping the cosmic flows of the fountain, Pnevma has left the world and its fate to stagnate, and she has stolen the wits of the endermen. Only by slaying Pnevma and freeing the flow may the world have even a chance of being saved from the affliction.

## The Wither, Hand of the Plague
An amalgamation of failed simulacrums, the Wither is the embodiment of the decaying force of the affliction that created the skeletons. It cares only to infect intelligent life and was the main spreader of the decay. Once its corrupted purpose was served, it collapsed into a heap of bones and skulls.

Reawakened by the player, the Wither's new purpose is to kill them and any other sapient beings nearby. When slain, it will drop its nether star: a crystalized power source formed from charged souls.

## Architects' Siege & The Fallen Sentinel of the Deep
The siege is begun by an influx of power in the ancient portal, twisted by madness to allow the spirits of the dead to come forth, twisted by sculk and madness. The portal, while stabilized by Elrunez, is tainted by insanity and will not become usable until the madness settles.

The energy stolen from the warden by the ancient portal eventually retakes the shape of the warden, now an entity only of mind, soul, and madness. Destroying this entity will stabilize the portal.


# Miscellanious Entities
Many beings inhabit the world or have inhabited the world. These are the ones not explained elsewhere.

## Spiders
Their origins are unknown. They were here long before the Vesicans, and they seem to know well enough to avoid attacking the other monsters.
