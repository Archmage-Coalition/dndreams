# The Affliction
The affliction is the root of undeath, the source of madness and consumption, and the undoing of the ancient Vesican empire. It manifests itself in several forms based on the various aspects of mind and soul.

At its heart, the affliction is a plague born of necromantic origin, created by those who wished to utilize the power of mind and soul to live eternally and reach the Haven illegitimately.

## Zombification
The affliction turned the souls of the Vesicans rancid and consumed them until all that was left were zombified husks. Much of intelligent life has been zombified. But some intelligent life still prevails

## Wither
Withering is a horrid rot of the flesh that is responsible for the skeleton varieties and the soul aggregates of the Nether.

## Sculk
The first form of the affliction, sculk is soul twisted into a cancer that taints the world. Enough soul has been concentrated in the depths of the mountains to create Wardens, titans containing a nearly limitless supply of raw, concentrated soul, always hungering for more.

## Madness
The same force that twisted soul to sculk twisted dream to madness. The shadows have congealed into terrible monsters that haunt the world, looking for those whose minds have been bent toward imagination enough to interact with them.


# The Other Realms
The many realms of the world are split into 2 categories: the Physical Realms and the Spirit World.

## The Overworld
The Overworld is the primary realm of the world. It is where the Vesicans originated and fell, and it was hurt the worst by the onset of the affliction.

## The Nether
The Nether is the demonic home world and a hellish reflection of the Overworld.

## The End
The End was once home to dragons, but they have long since perished (cause currently undecided; probably genocide). Now, the only dragon to remain is Pnevma, the Ender Dragon, and even she was synthetically created. The End is resultingly now barren, except for the gardens of marble populated by the angels that Elrunez banished there. It contains the World Fountain, from which fate and change flows.

## Dream World
The Dream World is the land the mind taps when asleep, scratching the surface and experiencing within it nonsense. Methods exist to enter the Dream World while still lucid. The Dream World is the lower layer of the Spirit World.

## The (Forsaken) Haven
The Haven is the upper layer of the Spirit World. It was once the land of the dead, at least those benevolent, and it was thought that the secrets to immortality can be found there. It was also home to angels.

When the affliction began to taint the Overworld, it escaped into the Haven where it took the denizens like a plague. The dead were twisted into the Enkantal, beginning a ceaseless battle against the angels of the realm.

During the Age of the Illagers, Elrunez the Archmage opened the long-sealed portal to the Haven and took control of it. In a complicated coup, Elrunez banished the angels who stood against him and crowned himself Lord of the Spirit World. The angels he banished alongside Aktina, the former ruler of the Spirit World, were known as the Katharei, and those loyal to Elrunez became the Talei.


# The Affliction's Onset [Deprecated]
The Vesicans were a race of humanoids adept in construction of tools and structures. They lasted an unknown amount of time, but what is known is that they were destroyed by their negligence.

## The Spark
The first sources of magic to be discovered were amethyst and rose quartz. They were used to tap into the energies of the mind and soul. It started small with simply turning memories to dust, but soon they began liquifying souls.

Using these resources and others available, the Vesicans were able to construct portals to the End. Using cosmic fluid, they were able to turn dreams to powder and enter the Dream World.

## The Blight
Direct attempts to extend the Vesicans' lives exploded into sculk. Next, they attempted to create new life instead, and they succeeded in creating the creepers: living demolition instruments. However, the creepers lacked an intelligence, and the attempts to give them one instead created the Madness, a force that threatened those distanced too far from reality with Tormentors.

Over time, the sculk amassed enough energy to form the wardens. As immense power sources, the Vesicans realized they may contain the energy to open a gate to a realm even higher than that of the Dream. They designed a gate that would absorb all the power from a warden to open a portal that would lead to the Haven.

When the Vesicans attempted the process of powering the portal with a warden, the portal absorbed too much energy from the Warden and became overloaded, unequipped with the ability to contain it all. The portal convulsed and ruptured, scattering a terrible malady - the Affliction - all across both the Overworld and the Haven.

All the Vesicans within a mile were turned to zombies who continued to spread the blight. The souls of the dead in the Haven turned into the Enkantal, which began to attack the angels. Many of those whom survived fled to the Nether. In an act of desperation, they tried to construct simulacrums which could house their souls. These too failed, withering to bone. The simulacrums turned to wither skeletons, which spread the decay to the Vesicans.

## The Aftermath of the Vesicans
All the structures of the Vesicans were left for abandoned or house undead. The sculk was allowed to spread far through the caves in which they were produced. Opal, being the gemstone of the Haven, lost much of its holy energy and turned to rose quartz. Meanwhile, the divine metal of silver seemed to vanish from all record with the fall of angels.

The illager race evolved long after the fall of the Vesicans. The zombies could sense their intelligence and attempted to convert them, but they were more resistant to the affliction than the Vesicans. They discovered some of the remains of the Vesicans, including the ancient cities, but they were mostly unsuccessful with rebuilding them.

## The Lord of Torment
Elrunez was a powerful mage among the illagers. The details of his rise to power among illagers remain a mystery, but his insights into new forms of magic are not. He developed a way to unravel his own sanity and inflict upon himself a madness that let him see the congealing shadows. With this, he discovered the Formless Flame and took it for himself, achieving magical dominance among his peers.

Using the threads of his own sanity, Elrunez was able to reinforce the ancient portal frame against overloading. After properly tuning the portal frame, he used a warden to fuel the portal, which managed to remain stable after overloading. However, the portal remained over-concentrated and, rather than leading to the Haven, the portal let out the spirits of those taken by sculk. This lasted until the portal's energy reached stable levels, at which point Elrunez entered.

Once inside, Elrunez staged a coup on the angelic throne, managing to overthrow Aktina. Elrunez then banished the angels not loyal to him, who escaped to the End, where they now reside. Aktina, however, was locked away alongside the power to reopen the portal to the Haven. As such, the portal was sealed.

## Pnevma, the Ender Dragon
The Ender Dragon was constructed by Elrunez to control the World Fountain. By stopping the cosmic flows of the fountain, Pnevma has left the world and its fate to stagnate, and she has stolen the wits of the endermen. Only by slaying Pnevma and freeing the flow may the world have even a chance of being saved from the affliction.

## The Wither, Hand of the Plague
An amalgamation of failed simulacrums, the Wither is the embodiment of the decaying force of the affliction that created the skeletons. It cares only to infect intelligent life and was the main spreader of the decay. Once its corrupted purpose was served, it collapsed into a heap of bones and skulls.

Reawakened by the player, the Wither's new purpose is to kill them and any other sapient beings nearby. When slain, it will drop its nether star: a crystalized power source formed from charged souls.

## Architects' Siege & The Fallen Sentinel of the Deep
The siege is begun by an influx of power in the ancient portal, twisted by madness to allow the spirits of the dead to come forth, twisted by sculk and madness. The portal, while stabilized by Elrunez, is tainted by insanity and will not become usable until the madness settles.

The energy stolen from the warden by the ancient portal eventually retakes the shape of the warden, now an entity only of mind, soul, and madness. Destroying this entity will stabilize the portal.


# Miscellanious Entities
Many beings inhabit the world or have inhabited the world. These are the ones not explained elsewhere.

## Spiders
Their origins are unknown. They were here long before the Vesicans, and they seem to know well enough to avoid attacking the other monsters.
