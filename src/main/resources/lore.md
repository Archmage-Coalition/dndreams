# The Affliction
The affliction is the root of undeath, the source of madness and consumption, and the cause of the fall of Koinans. It manifests itself in several forms based on the various aspects of mind and soul.

At its heart, the affliction is a plague born of necromantic origin, created by those who wished to utilize the power of mind and soul to open a gate to the Haven and live eternally.

Zombification
---
The affliction turned the souls of the Koinans rancid and consumed them until all that was left were zombified husks. Much of intelligent life has been zombified. Some of those that are not are still susceptible, but the airborne affliction is not enough to affect them.

Wither
---
Withering is a horrid rot of the flesh that is responsible for the skeleton varieties and the soul aggregates of the Nether.

Sculk
---
The first form of the affliction, sculk is soul twisted into a cancer that taints the world. Enough soul has been concentrated in the depths of the mountains to create Wardens, titans containing a nearly limitless supply of raw, concentrated soul, always hungering for more.

Crimson
---
Crimson is a stain wrought from bringing the magic of vitality out of the dream and into reality. It strengthens the undead taken by the affliction and increases their ability to spread.

Madness
---
The same force that twisted soul to sculk twisted dream to madness. The shadows have congealed into terrible monsters that haunt the world, looking for those whose minds have been bent toward imagination enough to interact with them.


# Spirit World
The Spirit World is the holy land. It is made up of 2 layers: the Dream World and the Haven.

Dream World
---
The Dream World is the land the mind taps when asleep, scratching the surface and experiencing within it nonsense. Methods exist to enter the Dream World while still lucid. The Dream World is the lower layer of the Dream World.

The (Forsaken) Haven
---
The Haven is the upper layer of the Spirit World. It was once the land of the dead, at least those benevolent, and it was thought that the secrets to immortality can be found there. It was also home to angels.

When the affliction began to taint the Overworld, it escaped into the Haven where it took the denizens like a plague. The dead were twisted into the Enkatal, and the angels fell, becoming the Talei.

During the Age of the Illagers, Elrunez the Archmage opened the long-sealed portal to the Haven and took control of it. Elrunez named himself the Nightmare Lord and takes up residence in the Soul Spire.


# The Affliction's Onset
The Koinans were a race of humanoids adept in construction of tools and structures. They lasted about 10,000 years before falling to their own creation.

The Spark
---
The first sources of magic to be discovered were amethyst and silver. They were used to tap into the energies of the soul.

The Fall

The Aftermath

# Miscellanious Entities
Many beings inhabit the world or have inhabited the world. These are the ones not explained elsewhere.

Spiders
---
Their origins are unknown. They were here long before the Koinans, and they seem to know well enough to avoid attacking the other monsters.

Creepers
---
They were synthetically created by the Koinans to assist in demolition. With the downfall of the Koinans, they became feral. They think the player for an imposter.
