The Affliction
===
The Affliction is the root of undeath, the source of madness and simpletons, and the cause of the fall of builders. It manifests itself in several forms and is a baleful source of magic.

At its heart, the Affliction is a plague born of necromantic origin, created by those who wished to utilize the power of soul and mind to open a gate to the Haven.
